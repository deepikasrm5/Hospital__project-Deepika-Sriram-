                          <p>Vaccines are arguably one of the greatest inventions of medical science of all time. Now, researchers are looking to take vaccine technology one step further to protect against neurodegenerative diseases like dementia. In this Special Feature, we asked experts about what is currently under development, how a dementia vaccine would work, and how quickly we may see one becoming available to the public.</p>

                          <p>For the first time, researchers have used CRISPR gene-editing technology to substitute a gene in a patient’s immune cells to redirect those cells to fight cancer.“CRISPR is by itself a newer technology, and the fact that they can do the change and remove at the same time,” said Dr. Martir-Negron. “That is what is amazing because in the past […] it would have been almost impossible to do the two things.”</p>

                          <p>Type 2 diabetesTrusted Source (T2D) is a chronic condition where the body does not respond to insulin normally. Insulin is a critical component that enables the body’s cells to use glucose for energy.
                        People who are at risk for diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes can follow eating plans that help them manage their diabetes and improve their physical well-being. Each person will have slightly different needs, but organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source offer some general recommendations.
                        For example, some people with type 2 diabetes should limit carbohydrates and increase their intake of non-starchy vegetables. Starchy vegetables such as beans and potatoes contain carbohydrates, but that doesn’t mean people with diabetes or insulin resistance must eliminate them completely.</p>

                          <img src="../../assets/images/puff.JPG">
                          <p>Asthma is a respiratory condition that impacts an estimated 262 millionTrusted Source people worldwide. It is characterized by inflammation of the small airways, leading to symptoms including shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing.
                        Research from 2016Trusted Source suggests that asthma may play a role in atherosclerosisTrusted Source — the buildup of plaque, or fatty deposits, on artery walls. Still, the associations between asthma and heart disease are unclear.
                        Yet a 2020 studyTrusted Source found that people with persistent asthma may have up to 1.5 times higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation (AFib) than those without the respiratory condition.                     
                        Recently, a new study found that participants with persistent asthma have a greater likelihood of plaque buildup in their carotid arteries than those without asthma.                        
                        The findings persisted even after the scientists adjusted for demographic and lifestyle factors. Moreover, those with persistent asthma also had higher levels of inflammatory markers in their blood.</p>
